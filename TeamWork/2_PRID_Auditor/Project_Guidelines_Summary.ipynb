    "## 1. Project Phase 1: Initiation and Planning\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q1: What are the primary objectives of the Major Project phase?\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "- **Skill Application:** To apply theoretical knowledge to solve real-world engineering problems.\n",
    "- **Innovation:** To research and implement creative solutions in modern domains (AI, IoT, Cloud, Security).\n",
    "- **Collaboration:** To work effectively in a team (max 5 members) and follow industrial development standards.\n",
    "- **Documentation:** To learn professional report writing and project presentation techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2: List the critical milestones for project approval.\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "1. **Domain Selection:** Identifying a problem area (e.g., Cybersecurity, Web App).\n",
    "2. **Guide Allocation:** Finalizing a faculty supervisor to oversee technical progress.\n",
    "3. **Synopsis Submission:** A 2-3 page document defining objectives, methodology, and tools.\n",
    "4. **Approval Presentation:** Defending the project's feasibility and scope before a department panel.\n",

    "## 2. Project Phase 2: Design and Development\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3: What diagrams must be included in the project design document?\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "- **System Architecture:** A high-level overview of components (e.g., Frontend, Backend, Database).\n",
    "- **UML Diagrams:** \n",
    "  - **Use Case Diagram:** Shows interactions between actors and the system.\n",
    "  - **Class Diagram:** Defines static structure and relationships.\n",
    "  - **Sequence Diagram:** Shows object interactions over time.\n",
    "- **ER Diagram:** Database schema design.\n",
    "- **Flowcharts:** Logic for critical backend algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4: Explain the importance of version control in a group project.\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "- **Conflict Prevention:** Tools like Git allow multiple students to work on different parts of the code simultaneously (e.g., the PRID framework we used).\n",
    "- **Recovery:** Ability to revert to previous working states if a new feature breaks the system.\n",
    "- **Audit Trail:** Clear visibility of who contributed what, which helps in the final Viva assessment.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Q5: What are the key components of the final project report?\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "1. **Introduction:** Background and Problem Statement.\n",
    "2. **Literature Survey:** Review of existing solutions and technologies.\n",
    "3. **Requirements Analysis:** SRS (Software Requirement Specification).\n",
    "4. **Design:** Architectural and UML diagrams.\n",
    "5. **Implementation:** Code snippets, screenshots of the UI.\n",
    "6. **Testing:** Test cases (Unit, Integration, System) and results.\n",
    "7. **Conclusion & Future Scope:** What was achieved and what can be improved.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q6: How should a student prepare for the External Viva Voce?\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "- **Individual Contribution:** Be ready to explain exactly what *you* built (your PRID zone).\n",
    "- **Code Walkthrough:** Understand every line of the core logic, even if a teammate wrote it.\n",
    "- **Theoretical Alignment:** Relate project features to course subjects (e.g., \"We used RSA for security as studied in DIS\").\n",
    "- **Demonstration:** Ensure the project is locally hosted and ready for a live demo during the exam."
